## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-12-24](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-12-24.md):
3 Regressions, 5 Improvements
Major event this week is landing PGO for rustc (on x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu). We
expect other platforms to follow but further investigation will be needed,
especially for cross-compiled platforms. We expect to add LLVM PGO as well.

Triage done by @simulacrum.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-12-24.md) for more.
